"""REPLACE WITH YOUR AUTH.

``require_user()`` stands in for your CRM's own login. As shipped it lets
every request through as the user in SAMPLE_USER_ID, which is only safe on
your own machine. In your app, verify the session cookie or bearer token
here, answer 401 when there is none, and set ``g.user`` to your user.

That id becomes the ``sub`` of every site token this server mints. Drop
Cowboy uses it for attribution only; your users never need a Drop Cowboy
login.
